This is a summary of cyber security concepts discussed across nine videos:

**I. Security Compliance and Frameworks:**
*   Organizations must implement security measures to defend against attacks, adhering to standards, regulations, and guidelines like PCI DSS (credit card transactions), HIPAA (patient data privacy), SOX (financial reporting for public companies), and GDPR (EU data privacy).
*   Cyber security frameworks, such as NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls, provide structured approaches to managing and mitigating cyber risks. The NIST framework includes the functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. ISO 27001 focuses on risk assessment, security controls, and continuous improvement. CIS Controls are divided into basic, foundational, and organizational categories.

**II. Types of Hackers:**
*   Hackers vary by agenda, methodologies, and skills.
*   **White hat hackers (ethical hackers)** perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Black hat hackers** exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
*   **Gray hat hackers** operate between white and black hats, potentially disclosing vulnerabilities.
*   Other types include script kiddies (amateurs using pre-made tools), green hat hackers (newbies eager to learn), blue hat hackers (revenge-driven novices), red hat hackers (aggressive against black hats), state-sponsored hackers, hacktivists (politically motivated), and malicious insiders/whistleblowers.

**III. Cyber Threats and Attack Vectors:**
*   Cyber threats aim to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information systems and data.
*   Common threats include malware (viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware), phishing, ransomware, man-in-the-middle attacks, SQL injection, DoS/DDoS attacks, advanced persistent threats (APTs), zero-day exploits, and insider threats.
*   Attack vectors are methods by which threats are delivered. These include email phishing, malicious websites (drive-by downloads), unsecured Wi-Fi, software vulnerabilities, infected USB drives, insider actions (malicious or negligent), social engineering, and misconfigured cloud services.

**IV. Cyber Attacks - Detailed:**

*   **Malware:** Malicious software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system by stealing passwords or money.
*   **Phishing:** Attempts to obtain private information posing as a trustworthy entity for identity theft or financial gain.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwhelming a network with traffic, causing it to crash and becoming inaccessible.
*   **SQL Injection:** Insertion of malicious code in SQL statements via webpage input to breach security and access protected data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages to steal user data or hijack sessions.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Attacks targeting unknown software/hardware vulnerabilities before a patch is available.
*   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating individuals to share sensitive information.
*   **IoT Exploitation:** Attacks targeting vulnerabilities in connected devices.
*   **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Long-term targeted attacks for espionage or data theft.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties to steal sensitive information.

**V. Key Security Concepts:**
*   **Threat:** An action that could harm a system's normal operation.
*   **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system.
*   **Exploit:** Code or method that leverages a vulnerability.
*   **Risk:** Quantifying the likelihood and cost of a threat.
*   **Controls/Countermeasures:** Measures to mitigate risks (technical, administrative, and procedural).

**VI. Responsibilities of Cyber Security Professionals:**
*   Implementing security measures, securing data, detecting and responding to threats, managing identity and access, conducting security audits, training employees, monitoring security trends, implementing security policies, ensuring regulatory compliance, and planning for disaster recovery.

**VII. Historical Perspective:**
*   Cyber security has evolved from physical access controls in early systems to combating sophisticated state-sponsored attacks and AI-driven threats. Key milestones include the emergence of the first viruses and worms, the formalization of cyber security practices, the rise of data breaches, and the increasing importance of regulation and technological advancements.

**VIII. Core Principles of Cyber Security:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized individuals.
*   **Integrity:** Protecting data from unauthorized alteration.
*   **Availability:** Ensuring resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.
*   **Authentication:** Verifying user and device identities.
*   **Non-Repudiation:** Ensuring actions can be proven and not denied.
*   Cyber security is crucial for protecting sensitive data, preventing financial loss, maintaining business continuity and reputation, complying with regulations, safeguarding national security, and enabling technological advancements.
