Mini-Project - Use Wireshark to Capture and Analyze Network Traffic

ShieldGuard Inc. Technical Lab

Imagine peeking into the digital highways of your network, where packets of data travel to their destinations, carrying vital information. With a tool like Wireshark, you gain the ability to observe, analyze, and
even troubleshoot this unseen flow of communication. It's like having a magnifying glass to explore the lifeblood of your network.

In this project, you'll use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, uncovering valuable insights about how data moves and identifying potential security concerns.

1. Objective

Your mission is to use Wireshark to capture network traffic, analyze the captured data, and identify patterns, anomalies, or security threats.

2. Key Requirements

Setup

Install Wireshark on your computer.

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to capture live traffic on your network interface.

Scope of Analysis

Capture packets for a specific duration or during specific activities (e.g., loading a website, sending an email).

. Focus on protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and TCP/IP.

.

3. Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Set Up Wireshark

. Download Wireshark from its official Website

· Wireshark

Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface to monitor.

. Start capturing traffic by clicking the Start Capturing Packets button.

Step 2: Capture Network Traffic

Perform network activities such as:

. Browsing a website.

. Sending an email.

. Accessing a shared resource.

Stop the capture after sufficient data has been collected.

.Step 3: Filter Captured Traffic

. Use Wireshark filters to narrow down the data:

. `http - Display HTTP traffic.

. `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1' - Show packets involving a specific IP address.

`tcp.port == 80' - Focus on HTTP traffic.

Step 4: Analyze Packet Details

Examine individual packets to understand:

. Source and destination IP addresses.

· Protocol details (e.g., HTTP requests, DNS queries).

. Any anomalies such as suspicious IPs or repeated failed connections.

Step 5: Identify Security Concerns

. Look for potential issues like:

. Unencrypted data being transmitted.

. Unexpected IP addresses communicating with your network.

. High volumes of traffic that might indicate an attack.

4. Deliverable

Prepare a 1-page report that includes:

. A summary of your findings.

. Screenshots of key packet captures and analyses.

. Insights or recommendations based on observed traffic patterns.

By mastering Wireshark, you'll unlock the ability to visualize and diagnose your network like a seasoned professional.
