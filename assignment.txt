Create a Timeline Showcasing the Evolution of Cybersecurity

ShieldGuard Inc. Learning Initiative

Long ago, in the early days of interconnected machines, a harmless program called the Creeper Virus traveled across networks, playfully declaring, "I'm the creeper: catch me if you can." While innocent, it became the spark for what we now call cybersecurity. Fast forward decades, and the stakes have grown
exponentially-viruses, hackers, and breaches have shaped the digital world we live in today. From the birth of firewalls to modern encryption and Al-driven defenses, every milestone tells a story of resilience and innovation.

Understanding these historical milestones in cybersecurity can provide insights into the progression of threats, technologies, and defenses. This project will help you appreciate how the field has evolved and where it is heading.
