- [Lisa] An organization must
incorporate safeguards into
the security compliance plan
to defend against attacks.
Over the years, standards,
regulations, and guidelines,.
such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, and GDPR
have reduced the amount of data exposure.
The standards, regulations, and guidelines
are important to understand
as they outline the way an organization
should implement appropriate
security measures
to address and reduce overall risk.
Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard or PCI DSS,
is a set of widely accepted requirements
to secure credit card transactions.
PCI DSS is not a law or
government regulation.
It's an industry standard developed
by the payment card industry.
If you do any credit card
transactions, you must comply,
otherwise the company
will face hefty fines
and may lose the ability to
handle credit card transactions.
The Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act,
or HIPAA, is also called the Privacy Rule.
Now this is legislation
that governs data privacy
and security practices that safeguard
all patient electronic
Protected Health Information,
or ePHI, in US medical facilities,
along with reporting any breach activity.
Anyone who is in violation of
the policies and procedures
will face penalties.
Sarbanes-Oxley, or SOX,
is a set of compliance
requirements outlined
for public companies.
SOX specifies methods to create
and sustain security
controls, and procedures,
and conduct a yearly audit
to reduce corporate fraud
and protect investors.
US lawmakers created the 2002
Sarbanes Oxley Act or SOX,
in response to several
corporate accounting scandals
occurring between the
years of 2000 and 2002.
Let's take a look.
Now here we see that
the 10 worst corporate
accounting scandals of all times.
Here we see waste management
reported $1.7 billion
in fake earnings.
Here we see WorldCom inflated assets
by as much as $11 billion.
And in 2002, Tyco CEO stole 150 million
and then also inflated
company income by 500 million.
Now although all scandals
were significant,
in the early 2000s,
Enron, a large financially
sound Texas-based company,
committed several different crimes
along with fraudulent reporting
that were extensive and ongoing.
Shareholders eventually lost $74 billion.
The Enron scandal pushed the
American public and Congress
to recognize the need for
new compliance standards
for public accounting and auditing.
Although SOX has many sections,
sections 301 and 404 indirectly deal
with information assurance
and data integrity.
All companies must monitor
and manage all data
and financial transactions,
and provide an annual report
on what internal controls
are in place,
along with the effectiveness
of the controls.
Financial reports must
be accurate and complete,
with no evidence of
unauthorized transactions
or data manipulation.
GDPR, or the General Data
Protection Regulation
is a comprehensive data privacy law
that gives consumers
control of their data.
GDPR affects companies
located in and outside
the European Union, and
companies can face up to 4%
of total global turnover
if they breach the rules.
There are many standards and regulations
that provide guidelines so that
companies do their due care
and due diligence to ensure
data privacy and security.

introduction to cyber security
Frameworks in today's digital age cyber
security has become a top priority for
individuals and organizations alike with
the increasing number of cyber threats
and attacks it is essential to have a
comprehensive cyber security framework
in place to protect sensitive
information and data cyber security
Frameworks provide a structured approach
to managing and mitigating cyber risks
by outlining best practices guidelines
and standards in this article we will
explore three of the most widely used
cyber security Frameworks this cyber
security framework ISO 270001
information security management system
and CIS controls for Effective cyber
defense by understanding these
Frameworks you can better protect
yourself and your organization from
cyber threats and ensure that your cyber
security measures are up to par with
industry standards
2. this cyber security framework
the nist cyber security framework is a
set of guidelines and best practices
designed to help organizations manage
and reduce cyber security risks it was
developed by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology NISD in
response to executive order
13636 which call for the creation of a
framework that would help critical
infrastructure organizations improve
their cyber security posture the
framework consists of five core
functions identify protect protect
respond and recover each function is
further broken down into categories and
subcategories that provide more specific
guidance on how to implement the
framework
the identify function focuses on
understanding an organization's cyber
security risks and vulnerabilities this
includes identifying all assets systems
and data that need to be protected as
well as assessing the potential impact
of a Cyber attack
the protect function involves
implementing safeguards to protect
against cyber threats this includes
measures such as access controls
encryption and security awareness
training for employees
the detect function involves monitoring
systems and networks for signs of a
Cyber attack this includes implementing
intrusion detection and prevention
systems as well as conducting regular
vulnerability scans and penetration
testing
the respond function involves developing
and implementing a plan to respond to a
Cyber attack this includes establishing
an incident Response Team defining roles
and responsibilities and developing
procedures for containing and mitigating
the effects of an attack
finally recover function involves
restoring normal operations after a
Cyber attack this includes developing a
business continuity plan conducting
backups of critical data and ensuring
that systems can be quickly restored in
the event of an outage overall the nist
cyber security framework provides a
comprehensive approach to managing cyber
security risks by following its
guidelines and best practices
organizations can better protect
themselves against cyber threats and
ensure the confidentiality integrity and
availability of their sensitive data 3.
ISO 27001 information security
management system the iso 27001
information security management system
is a globally recognized framework that
provides a systematic approach to
managing sensitive information it
outlines a set of best practices for
establishing implementing maintaining
and continually improving an
organization's information security
management system the frame work is
designed to help organizations identify
and manage risk to their information
assets including confidential data
intellectual property and customer
information it also helps ensure
compliance with legal Regulatory and
contractual requirements related to
information security
ISO 27001 consists of several key
components including risk assessment and
treatment security controls and
continuous Improvement the framework
emphasizes the importance of a
risk-based approach to information
security which involves identifying
potential threats and vulnerabilities
assessing the likelihood and impact of
those risks and implementing appropriate
controls to mitigate them one of the
strengths of iso 27001 is its
flexibility the framework can be adapted
to suit the specific needs of different
organizations regardless of their size
industry or location it can also be
integrated with other management systems
such as quality management or
Environmental Management to create a
comprehensive approach to organizational
governance
overall the iso 27001 information
security management system is a valuable
tool for organizations looking to
establish a robust and effective
information security program by
following the framework's guidelines
organizations can better protect their
sensitive information reduce the risk of
cyber attacks and demonstrate their
commitment to security to stakeholders
and customers alike
4. CIS controls for Effective cyber
defense the center for Internet Security
Cas controls is a set of best practices
designed to help organizations protect
their systems and data from cyber
threats the controls are organized into
three categories basic foundational and
organizational
the basic controls include measures such
as inventory and control of Hardware
assets inventory and control of software
assets continuous vulnerability
management and controlled use of
administrative privileges these controls
are considered essential for any
organization that wants to establish a
strong cyber security posture
the foundational controls build upon the
basic controls and include measures such
as email and web browser protections
malware defenses data recovery
capabilities and secure configurations
for network devices these controls are
designed to provide additional layers of
protection against common cyber threats
finally organizational controls focus on
the policies procedures and training
necessary to maintain an effective cyber
security program these controls include
measures such as security awareness
training incident response planning and
penetration testing by implementing the
sys controls organizations can establish
a comprehensive cyber security program
that addresses both Technical and
organizational aspects of security the
controls are regularly updated based on
new threats and vulnerabilities ensuring
that organizations stay up to date with
the latest best practices in cyber
security

================================================================================
welcome to the tutorial do you know who
hackers are what do they do
what all are different types of hackers
are hackers always notorious people if
not this is the right video for you in
this tutorial I'll introduce the
well-known and lesser-known kinds of
hackers you should know this will help
you understand what kind of protection
you require for your system and who are
the faceless criminals targeting your
personal and business information before
you become proactive for your safety it
is essential to understand what you are
facing or fighting and as always watch
this video till the end to answer a few
questions based on the content of this
tutorial I used to image hackers as a
notorious guy wearing a ski mask to hide
his identity and used to be glued to his
laptop to find the vulnerability in
applications and use the same
vulnerability to exploit for his
personal advantage interests however
dramatic that may look it holds no truth
people think hackers are negative people
in the online world but we all know
there is more to the story just like
there are good and bad guys in the real
world with different shades of their
personality the types of hackers vary by
their agenda methodologies and skill
practice one white hat hackers there are
the right set of people who comes to our
rescue on the dark web white hat hackers
also known as ethical hackers are the
cybersecurity experts who help the
government and organizations by
performing penetration testing and
identifying loopholes in their
cybersecurity they even do other
methodologies and ensure protection from
blackhat hackers and other malicious
cyber crimes simply stated these are the
right people who are on your site they
will hack into your system with a good
intention of finding vulnerabilities and
help you remove virus and malware from
your system too blackhat hackers these
are the people are used to image a black
hat hacker is the type of hacker you
should be worried
black hat hackers are the culprit of a
new cybercrime these days while their
agenda may be monetary most of the time
it's not always just that these hackers
look for vulnerabilities in individual
PCs organizations and bank systems using
any loopholes they may find they can
hack into your network and get access to
your personal business and financial
information three gray hat hackers grey
hat hackers fall somewhere in between
white hat and black hat hackers while
they may not use their skills for
personal gain they can however have both
good and bad intentions for instance a
hacker who hacks into an organization
and find some vulnerability may leak it
over the internet or inform the
organization about it all depends upon
the hacker nevertheless as soon as
hackers use their hacking skills for
personal gain they become black hat
hackers there is a fine line between
these two so let me make it simple for
you because a grey hat hacker doesn't
use his skills for personal gain he is
not a black hat hacker also because he
is not legally authorized to hack the
organization's
cybersecurity he can't be considered a
white hat either so these where the most
commonly known and referred hackers but
there's more let's learn a little more
about other types of hackers as well
today for script kiddies a derogatory
term often used by amateur hackers who
don't care much about the coding skills
these hackers usually download tools or
use available hacking codes written by
other developers and hackers their
primary purpose is often to impress
their friends or gain attention however
they don't care about learning by using
off-the-shelf codes and tools these
hackers may launch some attacks without
bothering for the quality of the attack
most common cyber attacks by script
kiddies might include the OS and DDoS
attacks 5 green hat hackers these
hackers are the amateurs in the online
world of hacking consider them script
kiddies but with a difference these
newbies have a desire to become
full-blown hackers and are very curious
to learn you may find them engrossed in
the hacking communities bombarding their
fellow
with questions you can identify them by
their spark to grow and learn more about
the hacking trade once you answer a
single question the hackers will listen
with undivided attention and ask another
question until you answer all their
queries six blue hat hackers these are
another form of novice hackers much like
script kiddies whose main agenda is to
take revenge on anyone who makes them
angry they have no desire for learning
and may use simple cyber attacks like
flooding your IP with overloaded packets
which will result in DLS attacks a
script Kitty with a vengeful agenda can
be considered a blue hat hacker 7 Red
Hat attackers Red Hat hackers have an
agenda similar to white eye attackers
which in simple words is halting the
acts of black hat hackers however there
is a major difference in the way they
operate they are ruthless when it comes
to dealing with black hat hackers
instead of reporting a malicious attack
they believe in taking down the black
hat hacker completely red hat hacker
will launch a series of aggressive cyber
attacks and malware on the hacker that
the hacker may as well have to replace
the whole system 8 state nation
sponsored hackers state or nation
sponsored hackers are those who have
been employed by their states or
nation's government to snoop in and
penetrate through full security to gain
confidential information from other
governments to stay at the top online
they have an endless budget and
extremely advanced tools at their
disposal to target individuals companies
or rival nations 9 activists if you've
ever come across social activists
propagandizing is social political or
religious agenda then you might as well
meet activists the online version of an
activist activist is a hacker for a
group of Anonymous hackers who think
they can bring about social changes and
often hack government and organizations
to gain attention or share their
displeasure over opposing their line of
thought 10 malicious insider or
whistleblower a malicious insider or a
whistleblower may be an employee with a
grudge or a strategic employee
compromised or hired by rivals to garner
trade secrets of their opponents to stay
on top of their game these hackers may
take privilege from their easy access to
and
nation and the role within the company
to hack the system so here is a question
which of the following is not a category
of hackers one orange hat hackers two
white hat hackers three black hat
hackers four gray hat hackers
organization is facing unknown attacks
on the web applications they have
recently identified that there are a few
vulnerabilities in their web application
which of the following type of
professional hackers can help the
organization list down other available
vulnerability and suggest the remedies
one green hat hackers two white hat
hackers three black hat hackers four
hacktivists write down your answer in
the comment section we will share the
answer once we receive ten and sir
comments

trick individuals into revealing
sensitive information by pretending to
be a trustworthy
entity methods email fishing spear
fishing wailing and smishing SMS fishing
impact identity theft financial fraud
and unauthorized access to sensitive
information three ransomware definition
a type of malware that encrypts a
victim's data and demands a ransom for
the decryption key
impact data loss Financial loss
operational disruption and reputational
damage four man in the middle mm attacks
definition an attack where the attacker
intercepts and potentially Alters the
communication between two
parties impact Data Theft unauthorized
access and privacy breaches five SQL
injection definition an attack that
exploits vulnerabilities in a web
application's de datase by injecting
malicious SQL code impact Data Theft
data corruption unauthorized access and
system
compromise six denial of service dose

attacks definition attacks aimed at
overwhelming a system Network or website
with traffic rendering it unavailable to
users impact service disruption
Financial loss and reputational damage
seven advanced persistent threats apts
definition long-term targeted attacks
aimed at stealing data or spying often
orchestrated by nation states or
well-funded
groups impact significant data breaches
Espionage and long-term system
compromises eight zero day exploits
definition attacks that exploit unknown
vulnerabilities in software or Hardware
before the vendor has released a patch
impact high potential damage due to lack
of defenses and available
patches nine Insider threats definition
threats originating from within the
organization by employees contractors or
trusted
Partners impact Data Theft sabotage and
unauthorized access due to privileged
access and Insider
knowledge attack vectors attack vectors
are the methods or pathways through
which cyber threats are delivered to
their
targets understanding these vectors is
crucial for developing effective
defenses here are some common attack
vectors one email fishing attackers send
deceptive emails to trick recipients
into revealing sensitive information or
downloading
malware malicious attachments emails
containing attachments with embedded
malware Two web browsing malicious
websites websites designed to download
and install malware on visitor system
drive by downloads automatic downloading
of malware when visiting a compromised
or malicious
website three Network unsecured Wi-Fi

a Cyber attack is an attempt to gain
access to a computer network or system
by hackers cyber criminals or other
digital adversaries usually with the
intention of stealing releasing changing
or destroying users personal
[Music]
data cyber attacks can Target a wide
range of victims from Individual users
to Enterprises or even governments when
targeting businesses or other
organizations the 's goal is usually to
access sensitive and valuable company
resources such as intellectual property
customer data or payment details the
cyber attacks that we will discuss in
this video are malware malicious
software designed to infiltrate or
damage a computer system malware is
software that is installed on a computer
without the user's consent and that
performs malicious actions such as
stealing passwords or money malware is
one of the biggest threats to the
security of your computer tablet phone
and other devices malware includes
viruses spyware ransomware and other
unwanted software that gets secretly
installed onto your device fishing is
the term used to describe an attempt to
obtain private information in order to
use or sell it this information is
usually in the form of usernames
passwords credit card numbers bank
account information or other critical
data it is a fraudulent attempt to
obtain sensitive information such as
usernames passwords and credit card
details by posing as a trustworthy
entity in an electronic communication
denial of service attacks also known as
D these attacks aim to make a computer
or network unavailable by overwhelming
it with a flood of traffic causing it to
crash or become
inaccessible the goal of a Dos attack is
to render the target system or network
unavailable to its intended users
causing a denial of service for example
Black Friday sales when thousands of
users are clamoring for a bargain often
cause a denial of service but they can
also be malicious in this case an
attacker purposefully tries to exhaust
the site's resources denying legitimate
users access SQL injection is a code
injection technique that might destroy
your database SQL injection is one of
the most common web hacking techniques
SQL injection is the placement of
malicious code in SQL statements via
webpage
input SQL injection is a covert type of
Cyber attack in which a hacker inser
inss their own code into a website to
breach its security measures and access
protected data once inside they can
control the website's database and
hijack user
information SQL injection usually occurs
when you ask a user for input like their
username user ID and instead of a name
or ID user gives you an SQL statement
that you will unknowingly run on your
database cross- site scripting also
known as xss as injecting malicious
scripts into web pages that are viewed
by other users this this can lead to the
theft of user data or session hijacking
attacker injects website with malicious
scripts malicious scripts is activated
with each victim's visit to the site
victim's cookies or private credentials
like username password are stolen zero
day exploits attacks that Target
vulnerabilities in software or Hardware
that are unknown to the vendor or have
not yet been patched a zero day
vulnerability is a security flaw that's
unknown to someone's interest in
mitigating the flaw a zerod day EXP
explo when the hackers take advantage of
zero day vulnerability for malicious
reason a zero day attack is when hackers
leverage their zero day exploit to
commit a Cyber attack social engineering
attacks manipulate people into sharing
information that they shouldn't share
downloading software that they shouldn't
download visiting websites they
shouldn't visit sending money to
criminals or making other mistakes that
compromise their personal or
organizational
security a threat attacker does reach on
the target to find what weakness and
medium are best for the attack deceiving
the victim to develop a relationship
engaging the Target by spinning a story
and then taking control of the
interaction fraudulently obtain person
or financial
information convince the target to send
money or personal information closing
the interaction without being suspicious
and then remove all the traces of the
malware iot Internet of Things
exploitation attacks targeting the
security vulnerabilities of connected
devices such as smart home appliances
Industrial sensors or medical
devices iot taxs are cyber attacks that
gain access to users sensitive data with
the help of any iot device attackers
usually install malware on the device
harm the device or gain access to
further personal data of the company iot
attacks are cyber attacks that gain
access to users sensitive data with the
help of any iot Vice attackers usually
install malware on the device harm the
device or gain access to further
personal data of the company
advanced persistent threats also known
as apps are the long-term targeted
attacks in which an unauthorized user
gains access to a network and remains
undetected for an extended period
usually for Espionage or Data Theft like
a burglar forcing open a door with a
crowbar cyber criminals usually gain
entry through a network an infected file
junk email or an app vulnerability to
insert malware into a Target
Network cyber criminals implant malware
that allows the creation of a network of
back doors and tunnels used to move
around in systems undetected the malware
often employs techniques like rewriting
code to help hackers cover their tracks
once inside hackers use techniques such
as password cracking to gain access to
administrator rights so they can control
more of the system and get even greater
levels of access deeper inside the
system with administrator rights hackers
can move around at will they can also
attempt to access other servers and
other secure parts of the network from
inside the system hackers gain a full
understanding of how it works and its
vulnerabilities allowing them to harvest
the information they want at will
hackers can attempt to keep this process
running possibly indefinitely Or
withdraw once they accomplish a specific
goal they often leave a back door open
to access the system again in the future
man in the middle attacks and attacker
intercepts and potentially Alters
communication between two parties
without their knowledge this can be used
to steal sensitive information the
attacker can monitor the communication
between the two parties gaining access
to sensitive information like login
credentials personal data or
confidential business information in
some cases the attacker May alter the
data being
transmitted this could involve injecting
malicious content modifying messages or
redirecting the communication to a
different
destination to mitigate the risks
associated with cyber attacks
individuals and organizations should
adopt cyber security best practices such
such as regularly updating software
using strong and unique passwords
implementing firewalls and Antivirus
programs and staying informed about the
latest threats and
vulnerabilities additionally having a
robust incident response plan in place
is crucial for minimizing the impact of
a Cyber attack when it does occur

================================================================================
The story goes that the infamous bank robber, Willie [Sutton], was once asked, "Why do you rob banks?"
And he responded, "Because that's where the money is."
Makes a lot of sense, right?
Well, but that's not really where the money is these days.
Your local branch might have some money, for sure.
But where's the big money?
It's not in the bank.
It's online.
It's in their IT systems.
It's digitized.
It's ones and zeros.
So, if we're going to look at security, let's take a look at an analogy
that begins with a bank and the threats that we see there.
And let's take a look at what its similar IT component would be.
So what do we face in each of these?
Well, it starts off with this notion of threats.
So what is a threat?
Well, a threat is anything that is an action that could undo the operation of the system.
It threatens the operation-- normal operation --of the system; gives an adverse effect.
So we could have threats that, in the case of a bank, well, it might be a robbery.
And in an IT system, it could be a break in.
Or, it could be, let's say it's a malware campaign.
So that's the overall overarching threat, there's an analogy here.
Now, the next thing we have to think about is the threat actor.
In the case of the bank, that's the robber.
In the case of the IT example with a malware campaign,
it's the person who wrote the malware or who is distributing the malware.
Next thing to consider: vulnerabilities.
So vulnerabilities are anything that are weaknesses in the system.
What's a weakness in the system of a bank?
Well, banks have windows, and windows are made of glass, and glass is weak.
We'll talk about how that can be exploited coming up.
But that's the vulnerability, is the glass.
How about the tellers themselves?
They could be threatened to give over the money.
Other things could be procedures, like when the money truck arrives.
Do we have the path from the truck into the vault and vice versa well secured?
If the procedures are not right, then we could be vulnerable.
So what would be the IT example in this case?
Well, if we're talking about a malware campaign, it's probably taking advantage of some bug in the software.
So there's some vulnerability that has been introduced in the software itself.
So next thing to consider is an exploit.
So what would an exploit be?
In the case of a window, you could throw a rock through it.
Well, you can also throw brick through it.
Or you could throw a crowbar through it.
Those are three different exploits exploiting the same underlying vulnerability that glass is breakable.
Now we have the same kind of thing that can happen on IT systems.
But the exploit in the case of a malware attack is going to be some code-- the malware itself
--that leverages the underlying vulnerability in, say, the operating system, or in an application.
So it's going to do some kind of nefarious activity, overriding memory or something like that.
So that's our exploit.
Then we've got a consideration of risk.
Risk is basically quantifying and looking at what is the issue here.
What's the likelihood that this thing will happen?
What's the cost if it in fact does happen?
What's the probability?
What's the frequency?
Those are the things that we consider in risk.
And we have that both in the bank example and we have that in the IT example.
And then ultimately we look at things like controls; or sometimes we call these countermeasures in security.
Now in the bank, we're going to look at certain types of controls that are specific to that environment.
Like we're going to put alarms on the bank, we're going to put cameras, we're going to put guards in the bank.
What are we going to do in the IT system?
Well, there's different kinds of controls that we can put in cases here.
So, in fact, these controls are of three different types.
One is a technical control.
An administrative control.
And a procedural control.
So a technical control would be examples of things like we say, we're going to patch all of our software.
We're going to put anti-virus on all of our systems.
We're going to use an endpoint detection and response system as well, or in lieu of antivirus.
We're going to put something like a backup system so that we can recover data if it's been compromised.
We're going to have things like user training so that users know not to click on links
and fall for phishing attacks and things like that and end up in fact infecting their systems.
We could have other things like a SIEM-- security information event management system.
--or an XDR-- extended detection response system --that's essentially like the alarm system
that's looking and allowing us to do investigation across the IT environment.
And then we would have something for incident response.
What are we going to do once we have the problem?
How do we respond to it?
And that's what we call a SOAR, in the IT example-- a security orchestration and automation and response platform
--that allows us to bring all of these things together.
So these are the things we have to consider, if we were securing a bank, or if we're securing an IT system.
And now that the money is not so much in the bank, it's in the IT system.
This is what we have to focus our efforts on.

welcome to digital training Hub today
under the cyber security series we'll
discuss definitions and importance of
cyber
security let's Dive Right
In definitions and importance of cyber
security cyber security also known as
Information Technology security is the
practice of protecting systems networks
and data from digital
attacks these attacks aim to steal alter
or destroy information extort money from
users or disrupt normal business
operations cyber security encompasses a
variety of techniques tools and
practices designed to safeguard digital
assets and ensure the confidentiality
integrity and availability of
information key aspects of cyber
security
confidentiality ensuring that sensitive
information is accessible only to those
authorized to access it integrity
protecting data from being altered or
tampered with by unauthorized
parties availability ensuring that
information and resources are available
to authorized users when
needed authentication verifying the
identity of users and devices before
granting
access
non-repudiation ensuring that actions or
transactions can be proven and cannot be
denied by the parties
involved let us go through the
importance of cyber security shall shall
we one protection of sensitive data
personal information protects personal
data such as Social Security numbers

================================================================================
my name is George Craig and I'm a
network engineer here at Drager I'd like
to talk to you today about the key
security principles of CIA one of the
models we use to design policies for
information assurance is the
confidentiality integrity and
availability triad understanding these
concepts is important for any cyber
security and communication
confidentiality is the concept of
preventing disclosure of information and
is based on the principle of least
privilege encryption and privacy the
principle of least privilege States if
you don't need access to something you
shouldn't have it this applies to both
physical assets as well as information
based assets if you don't need access to
that locked room you shouldn't have a
key the encryption supports
confidentiality by making it more
difficult on disclosure taxes the
information you need to take an extra
step say decrypting of the data to
actually make use of it
confidentiality is all around us in the
media today whether it be through
Hollywood and spy movies where people
are trying to steal nation state secrets
or even through the news media where
they inform us that sometimes
governments try to intercept our
communications thereby compromising our
privacy integrity is another important
component of security where the goal is
to prevent manipulation of information
throughout its lifecycle we want to
maintain accuracy and consistency of the
information and prevent alteration from
unintended parties we think of a
financial institution in making a
deposit we'd want that deposit value to
be accurate if someone was able to say
reduce that in the future we would
consider that theft financial
institutions take great care in ensuring
the integrity of their transactions the
final component is availability
information to be useful must be
available when needed we hear about
issues of denial of service in the news
today where a malicious actor or even
just by mistake some resources
completely exhausted and some system
becomes unavailable
a financial institution for example may
have excellent policies on
confidentiality and integrity but if
they're not available when I need to
make a transaction I still have a
problem we don't always have the levels
of confidentiality integrity and
availability that we might want in
certain cases and in context we often
have to make prioritization decisions
for example banks are not always open
for use and even if we go into a bank we
may have to wait so availability is
often compromised when high
confidentiality or high integrity is
required finally another example is say
we have a bridge that has to be open for
ships to pass in this case
confidentiality really isn't a concern
at all in fact we want availability of
the schedule so that ship owners can be
sure when their product will arrive or
that pedestrians and automobiles would
know when there could be delays when the
bridge has to open what we really need
in this case is integrity we would want
authenticated and authorized users to
open and close the bridge for safety
reasons you wouldn't want to open the
bridge when pedestrians around there you
wouldn't want to close it when ship is
in there these are the three security
principles of confidentiality integrity
and availability here at trigger we
consider these every day when designing
our products thank you for listening and
please stay tuned for future episodes
